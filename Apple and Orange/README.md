# Apple and Orange

Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where *s* is the start point, and *t* is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point *a*, and the orange tree is at point *b*.

When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands *d* units of distance from its tree of origin along the *x*-axis. A negative value of *d* means the fruit fell *d* units to the tree's left, and a positive value of *d* means it falls *d* units to the tree's right.

Given the value of *d* for *m* apples and *n* oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range *[s,t]*)?


For example, Sam's house is between *s = 7* and *t = 10*. The apple tree is located at *a = 4* and the orange at *b = 12*. There are *m = 3* apples and *n = 3* oranges. Apples are thrown *apples = [2,3,-4]* units distance from *a*, and *oranges = [3,-2,-4]* units distance. Adding each apple distance to the position of the tree, they land at *[4+2,4+3,4+-4] = [6,7,0]*. Oranges land at [12+3,12+-2,12+-4] = [15,10,8]. One apple and two oranges land in the inclusive range *7 - 10* so we print
